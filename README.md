# url-qr-shortner

 This is my deep dive into little things in websites. 

 Starting simple: shorten URLs, generate customizable QR codes with different error correction levels, add custom aliases with proper validation. Then leveling up with analytics—tracking total clicks, unique visitors, geographic data, referrer sources, time patterns, device/browser detection, even cookie identification for return visitors and fingerprint for device change.

 I want to experiment with every storage type (memory, cookies, local storage, session storage, IndexedDB, server databases) to see what persists through refreshes, tab closes, or device switches. Eventually adding URL management features like editing destinations, expiration dates, password protection, Open Graph previews... then the advanced stuff: link bundles, A/B testing, UTM builders, branded domains, and a full API. It's a learning project that keeps expanding.
